- full equivaent of svm-train is -v was not passed
- -v N ==> 
   a) split traing set into N folds
   b) run training on all training subsets in parallel

      generate folds
      for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
        train_and_predict "$i" &
	echo 
      done
      wait
      calculate averaged accuracy/R/C here

   c) after each svm-train invocation run svm-predict
   d) calculate averaged accuracy
- implement HERISVM_TRAIN env. variable for overriding
   svm-traing executable. This variable should default ro svm-train.
   NB: Alternatives are liblinear-train  (see chmake for example)

- recall/precision?
  Suppose we have a binary classification. We have classes A and B.
  We calculate {t,f}{p,n} for class A. Then
  P = (tp + ...) /  ### This is for class A!!!
  R = (tp + ...) /  ### This is for class A!!!
  Then we do the same for class B
  Finally, calculate macro-averaged P and R
  P_m = (P(A) + P(B))/2
  R_m = (R(A) + R(B))/2
  F1_m = (F1(A) + F1(B))/2

NB: example
